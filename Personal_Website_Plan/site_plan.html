    <h1>The purpose and audience</h1>
    <h2>
      The audience of this Website are people who are looking to have custom
      projects made. The Idea is that this site will mimic what a website for a
      small business that creates custom wood projects. Many People go to places
      like etsy for these sorts of things but these sites are flooded with cheap
      or poorly build products.

    <h1>W08 - Personal Site Content</h1>
    <h2 class="blackfont">Why will people come to your site?</h2>
    <h3>
      People will come to this site to find small businesses that create custom
      products for their homes and offices. Right now most people have a very
      hard time finding people who are capable of making their dream product and
      so they give up and go to big showroom stores or home depot. Small
      business owners may also be struggling to find customers and come to us to
      advertise their company and hopefully make them some more money.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="blackfont">
      What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?

      What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      They will want to find people who are capable of building their project
      and visual representations of what the masters can build. They will need
      to get in contact with said masters in order to see if their vision is
      feasible and they are able to do it. They will then take transactions off
      of the website and commission the project with the small business
      directly. People may also want to get in contact with a master of the
      craft to gather more information. Even if they do not make a purchase or
      make contact with a craftsman they may be able to find inspiration or help
      for their own project.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="blackfont">
      What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The website will need to know their name and contact information so that
      when they contact contractors or master craftsmen they will be able to be
      contacted again at a later date. We will also need to find a way to get in
      contact with many small businesses in order to put them on our website and
      get them advertised to people. The website will also need to know the
      qualifications of the master craftsman and examples of his work to show
      customers. The website will also collect the names of the various
      businesses.
    </h3>
    <h2 class="blackfont">
      Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this
      information or complete the actions?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Because most small businesses do not have a standalone website and they
      are just spread out by word of mouth or social media. This will contact
      small businesses directly with customers who need more information or want
      to see their vision made a reality. Many companies that boast selling with
      small businesses such as Etsy aren’ t very useful when it comes to
      commissioning projects. You can find small projects on there but it is
      nearly impossible to customize them. This will also get them in contact
      with custom cabinet makers, places like lowes let you customize your
      cabinets but it is from a selection of cabinets you aren’t able to truly
      customize the look and put your own touch on it.
